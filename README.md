# What is a Coming Soon page for? 
A "Coming Soon" page is a placeholder on a website that indicates that the full page will be available soon. It typically serves as a preview announcement for an upcoming launch of a new website or a new feature on an existing website. On a "Coming Soon" page, you may typically find a countdown to the official launch, contact information, a subscription form, and a preview of the future look and functionality of the page. These pages can help generate excitement for the launch and increase interest in the website.

# Benefit
"Coming Soon" pages are important for a website because they provide visitors with a first impression of what's to come. They can be used to generate excitement for an upcoming website launch, build an email list, or gather feedback from potential customers. Additionally, they provide an opportunity to establish the branding and messaging of the website before its official launch. In any case, "Coming Soon" pages enhance interest in a website and contribute to a successful launch.
